## 🧑‍💻 CodeClause Internship Task 2 - Blog Management Website 

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of Task 2 of the CodeClause internship project. In this task, we have created a blog management website using RESTful API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express.js, and EJS templating. Additionally, we have incorporated method overriding using an npm package due to the absence of PATCH and DELETE request support in HTML forms.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
Task 2 of the CodeClause internship project involves the development of a blog management website. The website allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It utilizes a RESTful API architecture for communication between the client and server.

## 🚀 Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>
The following technologies and tools were used in the project:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Express.js
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript) Templating
- Method Overriding Package (npm)

## 👉 REST API <a name="rest-api"></a>
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. In our project, we have implemented a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. Here is an overview of the supported API endpoints:

- `GET /posts`: Retrieve a list of all blog posts.
- `GET /posts/:id`: Retrieve a specific blog post by its ID.
- `POST /posts`: Create a new blog post.
- `PUT /posts/:id`: Update an existing blog post by its ID.
- `DELETE /posts/:id`: Delete a blog post by its ID.

## 🚀 Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run the blog management website locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/thepravin/Daily-Blog-Website.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Daily-Blog-Website`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once the server is running, you can access the blog management website by opening a web browser and visiting `http://localhost:8080/posts`. You can perform CRUD operations on blog posts through the user-friendly interface.
